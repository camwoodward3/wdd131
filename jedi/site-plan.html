        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My purpose is to create a website with all the Jedi that we saw in the Star Wars movies, series, and video games, and show what jedi was on the Jedi High Council, who fought in the Clone Wars, those who survived Order 66, and more.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Those who love Star Wars and those who want to know more about the Jedi Council and its members.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
        <p>I plan to make a ton of id's into my javascript since there will be a ton of Jedi mentioned in this website. </p>
        <p>I also want to make it so when I click on an image, it shows some information regarding the specific Jedi.</p>
        <p>I want to make a dropdown menu in the Jedi page so it scroll down titles. For example, if I chose Order 66 Survivors, they would show all the Jedi who survived Order 66.</p>

<p>The Jedi are part an ancient order of protectors united by their ability to harness the power of the Force. They adhere to doctrine that favors to the light side of the Force through calmness and meditation while avoiding emotions afflicted with the dark side of the Force, such as anger and hatred. The Jedi Council consists of Younglings, Padawans, Jedi Knights, Jedi Masters, and the Grand Master. 
    The Jedi  defended themselves by using lightsabers, the weapon of a Jedi, and a symbol of their role as guardians of peace and justice. Each of their lightsabers are different colors, depending on their connection to the Force. The blue lightsaber is for Jedi Guardians, who focus more no their lightsaber than the force. The green lightsaber is for Jedi Consulars, those who focus more on the force than the lightsaber. The yellow lightsaber is for Jedi Sentinels, those who focus more on other traits such as scholarly pursuits or practical skills. The Purple lightsaber is for those who use abilities from the dark side without being engulfed by its darkness. There are many other colors.
    The Jedi use their abilities with your lightsaber and the Force to do good and keep the peace around the galaxy, even if it meant to becoming generals of war, or whatever it took.
    All the Jedi were under the control of the Jedi High Council, which consisted of 12 Jedi Members, the best, the strongest, and the wisest of the Jedi. If a Jedi is unable to be on the council, due to death, a new Jedi will take his/her place. They are the ones who decided if Jedi are ready to become the rank of Padawan, Knight, and Master.

    Anakin Skywalker
    He was considered one of the strongest Jedi in the Jedi Order. He was compassionate and caring hero of the Clone Wars, but was also considered arrogant, reckless, and impatient in his actions. He was believe to be the Chosen One, the one who would bring balance to the Force. As a Jedi, he married Padme Amidala, which was forbidden to the Jedi Order, and was forced to keep it a secret.  After having visions of Padme’s death in childbirth, he turned to Palpatine, aka, Darth Sidious, and he became his new apprentice known as Darth Vader. He was responsible for the death of almost all the Jedi and the rise of the Empire.
